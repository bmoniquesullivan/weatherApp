This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Weather App

This WebApp was created to Display current Weather conditions. 

You can make your search by City names. If you want to search a city located on the United States of America, you can make your search using the city name followed de state it is located. e.g. "Atlanta, Georgia", "Dallas, Texas", "Las Vegas, Nevada", etc. But if you want to search for a city outside the U.S., you can type the city name followed by the country. e.g. "New Delhi, India", "Manaus, Brazil", etc.

The results will present to you:

* Temperatures in Celsius
* Current Conditions
* Minimun and Maximun Temperature in Celsius
* Wind Speed

## Technologies Used

This App was created using Node.js, React, and it was bootstrapped using 'create-react-app'. The package Manager is yarn, and you can see below the instruction on how to run the scripts. It was also used the https://openweathermap.org/ API to access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities!
Current weather is frequently updated based on global models and data from more than 40,000 weather stations.

## Components

Considering the simple, well-defined, and lightweight nature of the App, only a single component was created on the source of the project. If there's a future demand for scaling or improvement, aditional components can be added to vthe project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
